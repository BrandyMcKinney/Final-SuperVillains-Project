Super Villain Card API

This is a fun app that allows the user to add/delete a supervillain card and see all supervillain cards.

It was built using Flask, incorporates HTML (customized), CSS(provided template), data is store using SQLAlchemy database, this was an exercise in creating RESTful routes, using jsonify to convert data, adding response statuses and creating an API directory of
REST requests.

Next step is to add an edit feature to edit the cards to complete this fun app.
