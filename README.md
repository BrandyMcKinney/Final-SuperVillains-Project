# Super Villain Card API

This is a cute app that allows the user to create (add), delete, and display supervillain cards. It was built using Flask, incorporates HTML (customized) and CSS(through a provided template). The data is store using SQLAlchemy database. This project was an exercise in creating RESTful routes, using Jsonify to convert data, adding response statuses and creating an API directory of REST requests. The next version would be to create an edit feature to edit the cards.
